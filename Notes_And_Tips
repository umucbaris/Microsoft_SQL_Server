#Microsoft SQL Server is a database
  Also a database management system
  Also a relational database
  Also an OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) system

# Client Server Architecture
    Microsoft Access is just a database.
    You should use your Disk,CPU and Ram on Access
    SQL is connected to SQL Cloud server.
    Connecting to SQL server has to be on its own language
    SQL uses its CPU,Disk and RAM.
    This is the common thing of database management systems i.e. Oracle
    SQL is the global language of databases (Like English)
    SQL server's language is T-SQL
    Database admin continuously talks to the SQL server.
    
# Things that effect SQL Server query time
    -Disk = storage of data
    -AVG Disk Que Length = count of tasks waiting on a disk
        Parameter= AVG DQL must be <5 seconds
        Key is using faster disks
    -Registry = data
        Data Index complexity = Fragmentation
        Solution = Defragmentation
    -Ram = Workplace
        !Ram is not emptied until more space is necessary
        So parameter here is PLE(Page Life Expectancy
        PLE must be > Total RAM / 4 * 300 seconds
    -Ram Bus Speed is the most critical thing
        When you speed it 2x your task will be completed on almost 1/2 time.
    -CPU core count
        SQL server works parallel on Join tasks.
        More CPU cores, more parallel work and less overall time.
    -Clock Speed (CPU performance) new generations are better
    -Index fragmentation
        More work leads to data fragmentation
        You should do Index Rebuild work to avoid this
        Doing Index Rebuild as a routine: Setting a Periodical SystemCare Plan
    -Ad Hoc Query = tasks of a repeating project
    -Stored Procedure = storing each task on a function keyword
